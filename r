A typical example of ROI for the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform shows that organizations can achieve a 6:1 return on investment-for every $1 invested, companies realize $6 in value7. Independent studies have found even higher ROI figures, such as a 316% ROI with total savings of $6.7 million and a payback period of less than three months for a composite organization10. For specific modules like Falcon Identity Protection, the ROI was calculated at 310%, with $1.26 million in total benefits over three years and a payback period of under six months12.
Gains and Values from Using CrowdStrike
 
Significant     Threat Reduction: The platform identifies 96% more potential     threats in half the time, leading to a 61% reduction in the risk of a     major security incident7. 
Operational     Efficiency: Security teams are twice as effective, with 66%     faster investigations and a 90% reduction in support activities710. 
Cost     Savings: Consolidation of cybersecurity tools and automation     leads to substantial savings in IT and security operations710. 
Breach     Prevention: Organizations report not experiencing breaches after     deploying CrowdStrike’s identity protection solutions12. 
Advanced     Detection: AI and machine learning provide real-time threat     detection, reduced false positives, and protection against zero-day     attacks813.
Risks of Not Having CrowdStrike (or If It Becomes Unavailable)
 
Increased     Vulnerability: Without robust endpoint protection, organizations     face higher risks of breaches, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats13. 
Operational     Disruption: The 2024 CrowdStrike outage demonstrated that loss of     such a platform-even temporarily-can cause massive business interruptions,     with global losses estimated at over $5 billion and individual companies     like Delta reporting $500 million in damages from operational downtime9. 
Regulatory     and Legal Exposure: Outages or lack of adequate protection can     trigger regulatory scrutiny, mandatory incident reporting, and potential     legal action, especially in highly regulated sectors like healthcare and     finance6. 
Higher     Costs: Recovering from breaches or outages incurs direct costs     (remediation, legal, regulatory fines) and indirect costs (lost     productivity, reputational damage)96.
In summary, CrowdStrike delivers substantial ROI through breach prevention, operational efficiency, and cost savings. Not having it, or losing access, exposes organizations to significant financial, operational, and regulatory risks.

As a powerful tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally, Ollama gives developers, data scientists, and technical users greater control and flexibility in customizing models.
While you can use Ollama with third-party graphical interfaces like Open WebUI for simpler interactions, running it through the command-line interface (CLI) lets you log responses to files and automate workflows using scripts.
This guide will walk you through using Ollama via the CLI, from learning basic commands and interacting with models to automating tasks and deploying your own models. By the end, you’ll be able to tailor Ollama for your AI-based projects.

Setting up Ollama in the CLI
Before using Ollama in the CLI, make sure you’ve installed it on your system successfully. To verify, open your terminal and run the following command:
ollama --version
You should see an output similar to:

Next, familiarize yourself with these essential Ollama commands:
CommandDescription
ollama serve
Starts Ollama on your local system.
ollama create <new_model>
Creates a new model from an existing one for customization or training.
ollama show <model>
Displays details about a specific model, such as its configuration and release date.
ollama run <model>
Runs the specified model, making it ready for interaction
ollama pull <model>
Downloads the specified model to your system.
ollama list
Lists all the downloaded models.
ollama ps
Shows the currently running models.
ollama stop <model>
Stops the specified running model.
ollama rm <model>
Removes the specified model from your system.Essential usage of Ollama in the CLI
This section will cover the primary usage of the Ollama CLI, from interacting with models to saving model outputs to files.
Running models
To start using models in Ollama, you first need to download the desired model using the pull command. For example, to pull Llama 3.2, execute the following:
ollama pull llama3.2
Wait for the download to complete; the time may vary depending on the model’s file size.
                    Pro tip                    
 If you’re unsure which model to download, check out the Ollama official model library. It provides important details for each model, including customization options, language support, and recommended use cases.
                
After pulling the model, you can run it with a predefined prompt like this:
ollama run llama3.2 "Explain the basics of machine learning."
Here’s the expected output:

Alternatively, run the model without a prompt to start an interactive session:
ollama run llama3.2
In this mode, you can enter your queries or instructions, and the model will generate responses. You can also ask follow-up questions to gain deeper insights or clarify a previous response, such as:
Can you elaborate on how machine learning is used in the healthcare sector?
When you’re done interacting with the model, type:
/bye
This will exit the session and return you to the regular terminal interface.

Training models
While pre-trained open-source models like Llama 3.2 perform well for general tasks like content generation, they may not always meet the needs of specific use cases. To improve a model’s accuracy on a particular topic, you need to train it using relevant data.
However, note that these models have short-term memory limitations, meaning the training data is only retained during the active conversation. When you quit the session and start a new one, the model won’t remember the information you previously trained it with.
To train the model, start an interactive session. Then, initiate training by typing a prompt like:
Hey, I want you to learn about [topic]. Can I train you on this?
The model will respond with something like:

You can then provide basic information about the topic to help the model understand:

To continue the training and provide more information, ask the model to prompt you with questions about the topic. For example:
Can you ask me a few questions about [topic] to help you understand it better?
Once the model has enough context on the subject, you can end the training and test if the model retains this knowledge.

Prompting and logging responses to files
In Ollama, you can ask the model to perform tasks using the contents of a file, such as summarizing text or analyzing information. This is especially useful for long documents, as it eliminates the need to copy and paste text when instructing the model.
For example, if you have a file named input.txt containing the information you want to summarize, you can run the following:
ollama run llama3.2 "Summarize the content of this file in 50 words." < input.txt
The model will read the file’s contents and generate a summary:

Ollama also lets you log model responses to a file, making it easier to review or refine them later. Here’s an example of asking the model a question and saving the output to a file:
ollama run llama3.2 "Tell me about renewable energy."> output.txt
This will save the model’s response in output.txt:

Advanced usage of Ollama in the CLI
Now that you understand the essentials, let’s explore more advanced uses of Ollama through the CLI.
Creating custom models
Running Ollama via the CLI, you can create a custom model based on your specific needs.
To do so, create a Modelfile, which is the blueprint for your custom model. The file defines key settings such as the base model, parameters to adjust, and how the model will respond to prompts.
Follow these steps to create a custom model in Ollama:
1. Create a new Modelfile
Use a text editor like nano to create a new Modelfile. In this example, we’ll name the file custom-modelfile:
nano custom-modelfile
Next, copy and paste this basic Modelfile template, which you’ll customize in the next step:
# Use Llama 3.2 as the base model

FROM llama3.2

# Adjust model parameters

PARAMETER temperature 0.7

PARAMETER num_ctx 3072

PARAMETER stop "assistant:"

# Define model behavior

SYSTEM "You are an expert in cyber security."

# Customize the conversation template

TEMPLATE """{{ if .System }}Advisor: {{ .System }}{{ end }}

Client: {{ .Prompt }}

Advisor: {{ .Response }}"""
2. Customize the Modelfile
Here are the key elements you can customize in the Modelfile:
Base model (FROM). Sets the base model for your custom instance. You can choose from available models like Llama 3.2:
FROM llama3.2
Parameters (PARAMETER). Control the model’s behavior, such as: 
Temperature. Adjusts the model’s creativity. Higher values like 1.0 make it more creative, while lower ones like 0.5 make it more focused.
PARAMETER temperature 0.9
Context window (num_ctx). Defines how much previous text the model uses as context.
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096
System message (SYSTEM). Defines how the model should behave. For example, you can instruct it to act as a specific character or avoid answering irrelevant questions:
SYSTEM “You are an expert in cyber security. Only answer questions related to cyber security. If asked anything unrelated, respond with: ‘I only answer questions related to cyber security.’"
Template (TEMPLATE). Customize how to structure the interaction between the user and the model. For instance:
TEMPLATE """{{ if .System }}<|start|>system

{{ .System }}<|end|>{{ end }}

<|start|>user

{{ .Prompt }}<|end|>

<|start|>assistant

"""
After making the necessary adjustments, save the file and exit nano by pressing Ctrl + X → Y → Enter.
3. Create and run the custom model
Once your Modelfile is ready, use the command below to create a model based on the file:
ollama create custom-model-name -f ./custom-modelfile
You should see an output indicating the model was created successfully:
After that, run it just like any other model:
ollama run custom-model-name
This will start the model with the customizations you applied, and you can interact with it:

You can continually tweak and refine the Modelfile by adjusting parameters, editing system messages, adding more advanced templates, or even including your own datasets. Save the changes and re-run the model to see the effects.
Automating tasks with scripts
Automating repetitive tasks in Ollama can save time and ensure workflow consistency. By using bash scripts, you can execute commands automatically. Meanwhile, with cron jobs, you can schedule tasks to run at specific times. Here’s how to get started:
Create and run bash scripts
You can create a bash script that executes Ollama commands. Here’s how:
Open a text editor and create a new file named ollama-script.sh:
nano ollama-script.sh
Add the necessary Ollama commands inside the script. For instance, to run a model and save the output to a file:
#!/bin/bash

# Run the model and save the output to a file

ollama run llama3.2 "What are the latest trends in AI?" > ai-output.txt
Make the script executable by giving it the correct permissions:
chmod +x ollama-script.sh
Run the script directly from the terminal:
./ollama-script.sh
Set up cron jobs to automate tasks
You can combine your script with a cron job to automate tasks like running models regularly. Here’s how to set up a cron job to run Ollama scripts automatically:
Open the crontab editor by typing:
crontab -e
Add a line specifying the schedule and the script you want to run. For example, to run the script every Sunday at midnight:
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/ollama-script.sh
Save and exit the editor after adding the cron job.Common use cases for the CLI
Here are some real-world examples of using Ollama’s CLI.
Text generation
You can use pre-trained models to create summaries, generate content, or answer specific questions.
Summarizing a large text file:
ollama run llama3.2 "Summarize the following text:" < long-document.txt
Generating content such as blog posts or product descriptions:
ollama run llama3.2 "Write a short article on the benefits of using AI in healthcare."> article.txt
Answering specific questions to help with research:
ollama run llama3.2 "What are the latest trends in AI, and how will they affect healthcare?"
Data processing, analysis, and prediction
Ollama also lets you handle data processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and prediction.
Classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment:
ollama run llama3.2 "Analyze the sentiment of this customer review: 'The product is fantastic, but delivery was slow.'"
Categorizing text into predefined categories:
ollama run llama3.2 "Classify this text into the following categories: News, Opinion, or Review." < textfile.txt
Predicting an outcome based on the provided data:
ollama run llama3.2 "Predict the stock price trend for the next month based on the following data:" < stock-data.txt
Integration with external tools
Another common use of the Ollama CLI is combining it with external tools to automate data processing and expand the capabilities of other programs.
Integrating Ollama with a third-party API to retrieve data, process it, and generate results:
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/data" | ollama run llama3.2 "Analyze the following API data and summarize key insights."
Using Python code to run a subprocess with Ollama:
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(['ollama', 'run', 'llama3.2', 'Give me the latest stock market trends'], capture_output=True)

print(result.stdout.decode())
